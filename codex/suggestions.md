# Improvement Suggestions

- Add automated tests for the crawler, parser and API.
- Harden the Docker images by using non-root users and minimal base images.
- Consider adding an authentication layer to the REST API even for the community tier.
- Provide CI scripts for linting Python with flake8 and running unit tests.
- Expand the UI with status dashboards and crawl configuration.
